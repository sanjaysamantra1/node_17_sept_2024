Functions
==========
1. Function Declaration  (Named Function)
2. Function Expression   (Anonymous)
3. Self Invoked
4. Arrow Function  (ES-6)


Function Declaration vs Function Expression
===========================================
-Function Declarations have name, function expressions have no name
-Function Declarations are hoisted, function expressions are not hoisted

IIFE
====
-to execute a piece of code on application load, only 1 time
-IIFE cann't be called more than once
-to restrict var variables inside a block


Arrow Function 
==============
-Shorter syntax
-implicit return


How 'this' works in regular function and Arrow function
========================================================
Regular Function : 
    this - how the the function is called, from where the function is called
    this - is dynamic (changes , how it is called)
Arrow Function : 
    this - where the function is written
           Arrow function doesn't have it's own this binding
           arrow function always uses 'this' from lexical scope
           lexical scope - the place where arrow function is declared


Arrow Function Limitations
==========================
1. arrow functions should not be used as object methods
2. arrow function should not be used, if 'this' value has to be dynamic

Arrow Function Benefits
=======================
