Express Routers
===============
-Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

express.Router()
================
-express.Router() function is used to create a new router object.
-To create a new router object in our program to handle requests.
-Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers.
-router.use(timeLog) , adds a middleware for a router object



Serving static files in Express
===============================
-To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static() built-in middleware function in Express. 
express.static(root<directory Name>, [options])
-The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.
 app.use(express.static('public'))
-To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static() middleware function multiple times:
	app.use(express.static('public'))
	app.use(express.static('files'))
	
	

Middlewares
===========
-Middlewares in ExpressJS are functions that can modify Request and Response objects.
-Either to retrieve something from request Object or to store something in response object.
-An example of a simple express js middleware could be to log the current date and time on every URL the user visits on our website.

request => middleware1 => middleware2 => Route => Response

logger middleware
==================
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('The time is: '+ Date.now())
  next();
}

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:
1. Application-level middleware
   app.use(logger)
2. Router-level middleware
   const userRouter = express.Router();
   userRouter.use(logger);
3. Error-handling middleware
   try{
   }catch(err){
	 next(err); // transfers error object to error handling middleware
   }   
4. Built-in middleware
    express.static()
	express.json()        converts request body to JSON.     
	express.urlencoded()  converts form-data to JSON
5. Third-party middleware 
   cors , body-parser, cookie-parser
   


Q.How to run a middleware for all the routes in an application
  app.use(logger);
  
Q.How to run a middleware for all the routes for a router object
  const userRouter = express.Router();
  userRouter.use(logger);

Q.How to run a middleware for a particular route
  app.get('/route1', middleware,routeHandler);
  
 
 
authenticate middleware
=====================
const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (token === 'mysecrettoken') {
        next(); // User is authenticated, proceed to next middleware or route handler
    } else {
        res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
    }
};


Error handler
=============
let myError = (errF, req, res, next) => {
  const errorStatus = err.status || 500;
  const errorMessage = err.message || 'Something went wrong, Try again!';
 
  res.status(errorStatus).json({
    status: errorStatus,
    message: errorMessage,
    stack: err.stack,
    success: false,
  });
};
