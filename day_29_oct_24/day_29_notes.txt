Express Routers
===============
-Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

express.Router()
================
-express.Router() function is used to create a new router object.
-To create a new router object in our program to handle requests.
-Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers.
-router.use(timeLog) , adds a middleware for a router object



Serving static files in Express
===============================
-To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static() built-in middleware function in Express. 
express.static(root<directory Name>, [options])
-The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.
 app.use(express.static('public'))
-To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static() middleware function multiple times:
	app.use(express.static('public'))
	app.use(express.static('files'))
	
	

Middlewares
===========
-Middlewares in ExpressJS are functions that can modify Request and Response objects.
-Either to retrieve something from request Object or to store something in response object.
-An example of a simple express js middleware could be to log the current date and time on every URL the user visits on our website.

request => middleware1 => middleware2 => Route => Response
